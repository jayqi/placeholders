## Exporting from SVG

I used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for exporting.

1. Open in Inkscape.
2. Open the **Export** pane.
3. Select **Page** for what to export. (**Document** adds a margin because the width of the two line segments extend beyond the page.)
4. Put in your desired image size.
5. Select a destination file path and image format.
6. Hit **Export**.
